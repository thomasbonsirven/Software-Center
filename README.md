# Software-Center
# NOT WORK ON THIS REPO !

Software Center is a program that allows you to set up software that groups all the applications of your company.
I am building this software to find a similar solution to the SCCM / Microsoft Software Center without the paid license and the constraints of having a server.

## Requierements

For the moment, the test is only done on Windows 10.
It does not require a Windows Server and the database as well as sources can be placed on a web server.

The integration of a certificate and / or login is provided in the development to access the source of the software is the database.

Powershell runs on Windows, but also on Linux and MacOS. (Not tested on these)
In other words, if you can run powershell on your OS, my software will work.

PowerShell 3+
